# Tweeter Project


Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. It provides users with a responsive and interactive platform to compose and share short tweets in real time. The project focuses on implementing front-end interactivity, form validation, and dynamic rendering of tweets while maintaining a clean, responsive design for both desktop and tablet views.
